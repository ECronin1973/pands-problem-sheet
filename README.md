# pands-problem-sheet
This task required the creation of a pands-problem-sheet.
I created a pands-problem-sheet reporitory on github in order to save a helloworld.py file, readme.md file and gitignore within.  The benefit of using this repository was it allowed me to restrict who had access by making my visibility public or private.  As various changes were made to this reporitory throughout the exercise, I assessed what was asked for in the assignment brief, such as, when the programme is run it must read Hello World!. I initially misread what was asked of me similar to the previous exercise on mywork.  In order to complete this task I had to perform a pull request within Git.CMD to pull down mywork folder.  This then allowed me to make changes.  This is discussed in About Repositories section of the above link.  To save changes I used the command 'Git Add .' to save changes to the local directory.  This action is covered in the video in Lecture 'Git and GitHub'. Within the above link the section titled NAME states 'git-add is used to 'add file contents to the index'.  Following this I had to commit the changes to the repository in order for the documents to be visible for correcting.  The above link discusses git-commit and states that it is used to 'Record changes to the repository'.  The rationale for the changes is important, so the full command 'git commit - "reason for the change" ' is utilised.  Finally the changes had to be pushed up to the repository. The above link discusses git-push and states that it is used to 'update remote refs along with associated objects'.  I had to enter my passowrd for changes to be pushed up for security reasons.  I had previously created a password to ensure no other user on my computer could save changes to the repository.  Finally I tested the changes to ensure they were working correctly.  Once this was completed, the changes were checked in github.com

#Solutions to week 2 exercises
#author: Edward Cronin

#This week required revisiting all previous lectures for revision.  as per instruction of lecturer, each file had common header information entered - #file name # what file did when #run and #author
#additional questions answered and uploaded to repository

#further reading - format (the old way) outlines how to display results in bank.py file.
#x = int(input("Enter amount1(in cent): ")) #this allowed for capturing input 1
#y = int(input("Enter amount2(in cent): ")) #this allowed for capturing input 2
#ans = (x/100) + (y/100) # this adds the two inputs and divides each by 100 in order to convert cent into 'euro and cent'

#txt ="The sum of these is â‚¬{:.2f}"   # this allows for format to be with 2 decimal places
#print(txt.format(ans))   # this prints the output of ans as formatted
#sources #w3schools - string format - format() displays as 2 decimal places
